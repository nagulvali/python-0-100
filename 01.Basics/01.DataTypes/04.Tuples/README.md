# Python Tuples

- Tuples are used to store multiple items in a single variable.
- Tuple is one of 4 built-in data types in Python used to store collections of data, the other 3 are List, Set, and Dictionary, all with different qualities and usage.
- A tuple is a collection which is ordered and unchangeable.
- Tuples are written with round brackets.

```python
thistuple = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")
print(thistuple)
```
- Tuple items are ordered, unchangeable, and allow duplicate values.
- Tuple items are indexed, the first item has index [0], the second item has index [1] etc.
- When we say that tuples are ordered, it means that the items have a defined order, and that order will not change.
- Tuples are unchangeable, meaning that we cannot change, add or remove items after the tuple has been created.
- Since tuples are indexed, they can have items with the same value:
```python
thistuple = ("apple", "banana", "cherry", "apple", "cherry")
print(thistuple)
```
- To determine how many items a tuple has, use the len() function:
```python
thistuple = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")
print(len(thistuple))
```
- To create a tuple with only one item, you have to add a comma after the item, otherwise Python will not recognize it as a tuple.
```python
thistuple = ("apple",)
print(type(thistuple))

#NOT a tuple
thistuple = ("apple")
print(type(thistuple))
```

- Tuple items can be of any data type:
```python
tuple1 = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")
tuple2 = (1, 5, 7, 9, 3)
tuple3 = (True, False, False)
```

- A tuple can contain different data types:
```python
tuple1 = ("abc", 34, True, 40, "male")
```

- From Python's perspective, tuples are defined as objects with the data type 'tuple':
```python
mytuple = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")
print(type(mytuple))

#<class 'tuple'>
```


- It is also possible to use the tuple() constructor to make a tuple.
```python
thistuple = tuple(("apple", "banana", "cherry")) # note the double round-brackets
print(thistuple)
```
